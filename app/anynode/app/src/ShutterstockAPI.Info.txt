API reference
Overview
We’re still in Beta mode. If you have any feedback, please let us know.
The Shutterstock 3D Generative API, powered by NVIDIA Edify, revolutionizes the way developers and content creators generate 3D media. This cutting-edge API offers a seamless interface for transforming text and images into high-quality 3D models and HDRI images, leveraging the power of generative AI.

The API is designed to be simple to use, enabling seamless integration of generative 3D directly into your applications, platforms, pipelines, tools, and more.

For FAQs about the API, see Frequently asked questions.

Getting started
Quick Start Guide for the API coming soon.

In the meantime, check out the Quick Start Guide to get started with example applications using this API.

Examples
This API reference includes examples in Python and Typescript, as well as cURL commands that can be run from a command line. Most of the examples assume that your API token is in the $SHUTTERSTOCK_API_TOKEN environment variable.

Examples for cURL
The cURL examples work on the command line for many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, though you may need to install the cURL program.

Basic requests
Basic request: getting a generation status

import requests
import os

url = "https://api.shutterstock.com/v2/ai-generated/910de05a-a6ba-42fc-8b4b-c8fa9ced75b5"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('SHUTTERSTOCK_API_TOKEN')}"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.ok:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {response.status_code} {response.text}")
After you have authenticated to the API, you can send requests to the API using any programming language or program that can send HTTP requests. The base URL for all endpoints is https://api.shutterstock.com/v2/ai-generated/. For examples, see the right-hand pane. For more information about generating a token, see the Quick Start Guide.

  "output": [],
  "status": "generating",
  "error_code": null,
  "request_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000001"
}
Successful requests return a 200, 201, or 204 response code. For error responses, see Errors.

All endpoints return information in JSON format. Most programming languages have libraries that can accept and manipulate JSON data.

Errors
The API can return the following HTTP responses along with information about the error.

HTTP statuses and descriptions
These are the common response HTTP status codes and their descriptions:

HTTP status code	HTTP status	Description
400	Bad Request	Your request is invalid. Check the response for error message for details.
401	Unauthorized	Your API token is invalid. See Basic Requests.
403	Forbidden	The endpoint requested is not available for this API token. This may be due to the active generation limit, see Active generation limit section below.
404	Not Found	The requested object could not be found.
429	Too Many Requests	You have made too many requests. See Requests limit section below.
500	Internal Server Error	We had a problem with our server. This could be a temporary problem with the API. Check your request and try again.
503	Service Unavailable	The API may be currently down for maintenance or is overloaded.
Error shapes
There are two classes of errors that may be returned from this API.

The first are errors that can happen before the inference service request is started. Examples of this include errors related to authorization and input validation. To the right is an example of an input validation error (which returns a 401 http status response). This will include

{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "VALIDATION_OBJECT_REQUIRED",
      "message": "Missing required property: prompt",
      "path": "$.body.prompt"
    }
  ]
}
The other error class includes errors from the actual inference service. These errors commonly contain the original request inputs, including a status attribute with a value of failed and a referenceable error_code (see below). To the right is an example of one of these types of errors, where there are no credits remaining on this API account (this returns a 200 http status response).

{
  "id": "3a8386bf-4fa7-4ca2-9c4a-dff502a1a228",
  "workflow": "text-to-3d",
  "input": {
    "options": {
      "seed": 1412200967,
      "output_format_list": [
        "glb"
      ],
      "target_face_count": 20000,
      "texture_res_num": 2048,
      "turntable_format": "gif",
      "mesh_retopo_form": "quad",
      "mesh_adaptive_num_faces": true,
      "mode": "preview"
    },
    "prompt": "a goose riding a scooter"
  },
  "output": [],
  "status": "failed",
  "error_code": "NO_CREDITS_REMAINING",
  "request_time": "2024-12-01T08:22:12.534508+00:00"
}
The error_code attribute may have one of the following values:

Error code	Description
GENERATION_SERVER_BUSY	The API is overloaded. Try again later.
NO_CREDITS_REMAINING	The API token account has no generative credits remaining.
PROMPT_REJECTED	Something in the prompt is classified as unsafe. Modify the prompt and try again.
UNSUPPORTED_REQUEST_PARAMETER	One of the parameters in the request is not supported.
USAGE_LIMIT_REACHED	This request has exceeded the allowed usage limits.
VALIDATION_OBJECT_REQUIRED	One or more parameters in the request is invalid.
NO_SUCH_KEY	This error occurs when the key for the uploaded image is invalid or missing.
INVALID_ASPECT_RATIO	This error occurs when the uploaded image has a wrong aspect ratio.
Rate limits
There are two types of rate limits that requests are subject to.

Requests limit
All applications are limited to a certain number of API requests per minute. If your application exceeds its limit, the API returns an error response with a status code of 429. The message in the response states the UTC time in milliseconds for when the application's quota renews, as in this example:

{
  "message": "Too many requests",
  "limit": 100,
  "remaining": 0,
  "reset": 1624268836452
}
You can also access rate limit information from all requests via the response headers in the API response:

RateLimit-Limit - The allowed quota count.
RateLimit-Remaining - The available quota count in the quota interval.
RateLimit-Reset - The UTC time in milliseconds which determines when the quota expires and new quota interval starts.
To request a higher rate limit, contact us.

Active generation limit
API users are limited to the number of active generations at any given time. An active generation is one with a status of pending or generating.

The maximum number of active generations allowed is 5.

{
    "statusCode": 403,
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Max active generations: 5"
}
When a request is made that will exceed this limit, the API returns an error response with a status code of 403 and a message indicating that the maximum active generations limit has been exceeded.

Generating content
This API uses an asynchronous process to generate content. This section covers the generation request lifecycle and how to use preview mode for faster iterations.

How the API works
All generative workflows (e.g., text-to-3d) are asynchronous. This means that when an API client makes a request to generate content, it will receive a 200 status code and an id if the request is successful.

The client will then check the status of the generation using the provided id. While the status is "pending" or "generating", the client should keep checking for updates.

This process is shown in the diagram below:

Workflow Diagram
The status attribute in the API response tells you the state of the generation process and what the client should do next.

Here is a simple view of the statuses, their transitions, and meanings:

Status Diagram
Status	Description
pending	The request was received but generation hasn't started yet.
generating	The generation has started but isn't finished yet.
completed	The generation is finished.
failed	There was an error during generation, and the request was aborted.
Using preview mode
Want to see results faster? Use preview mode in text-to-3d or image-to-3d. This gives you quick preview images to check your inputs before making the full 3D model.

You'll get preview images (and turntables if you asked for them) in a zip file and as direct URLs. Once you like a preview, just send the same request again without the mode option. Make sure to use the same seed value (which is included in every response, even if it was randomly generated for you).

Preview Mode Diagram
Outputs
Overview
Every completed request includes:

An output URL to an archive file (type: "output_archive") containing all generated files
Additional output URLs for direct file access, based on the workflow type and request parameters
Output Structure
Each output item contains:

Field	Type	Description
url	string	Pre-signed download URL
type	string	Output classification
file_type	string	File extension
⚠️ The pre-signed URLs expire 15 minutes after being generated in a status request. Make a new status request to obtain fresh URLs.

For examples of output for various workflows, see the right pane.

{
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "output_archive",

      "type": "output_archive",
      "file_type": "zip",
      "url": "https://example.com/archive.zip"
    }
  ]
}
Uploading assets
For generation workflows that support user-provided assets (ex: an image for image-to-3d), uploads are handled with a two-step process.

First, use the Assets API to create an asset. The response from a successful request will include a key value and a url value.

curl --request PUT \
  --url 'https://example.com/...' \
  --upload-file 'path/to/file.png'
Next, make a PUT request to the provided url, including the bytes of your file. An example using cURL is provided to the right.

Finally, when you make your generation request, use the key value to reference this asset. For example, use this key value in the input_images array for image-to-3d generation requests.

Note: For the panorama-to-hdr workflow, the uploaded images must have a 2:1 aspect ratio.
