## Psychological Frameworks

### Jungian Psychology

#### Collective Unconscious
The collective unconscious is a part of the unconscious mind shared by all humans. It contains archetypes, which are universal, archaic patterns and images derived from the collective unconscious.

Key concepts:
- **Archetypes**: Universal, archaic patterns and images
  - The Self: The regulating center of the psyche
  - The Shadow: The unknown dark side of the personality
  - The Anima/Animus: The feminine aspect in men and masculine aspect in women
  - The Persona: The mask or appearance one presents to the world

#### Individuation Process
The process of psychological integration, having for its goal the development of the individual personality. It's a journey toward becoming one's true self.

Key stages:
1. Confrontation with the Shadow
2. Recognition of the Anima/Animus
3. Encounter with the Self

#### Psychological Types
Jung's model of psychological types includes:
- Two attitude types: extraversion and introversion
- Four functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition
