- The file `C:\Projects\LillithNew\src\council\council_integrity.py` defines a class `CouncilIntegrity`. This class appears to be responsible for managing seats within an organization or council and checking if a quorum is present. It does so by registering individual seats when they are filled, checking if all seats have been registered (indicating a quorum), and providing a report on the current status.
- This file is located under `/council`, which suggests that it might be part of a larger system or module responsible for managing councils or organizations within the application.
- The class seems to be implemented correctly, with methods for registering seats, checking quorum status, and generating a report. There are no apparent issues with missing imports, undefined variables, or unresolvable module references.
- This file does not appear to directly relate to the boot process or core service dependencies identified in the primary objective, so it will not be included in the final wiring map or scaffolds. However, if this class is used elsewhere in the application and its functionality is required for the system to function correctly, it may need to be considered when building the complete functional wiring report and generating minimal scaffolds.
