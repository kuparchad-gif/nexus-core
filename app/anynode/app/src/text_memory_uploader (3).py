The TextMemoryUploader component is responsible for pushing text memory files to the Memory service for storage. It does this by sending a POST request to the configured memory endpoint with the file data in binary format as part of the request payload. The function `push_text_memory` takes a file path as input and sends the corresponding file content to the Memory service. If the upload is successful, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints an error message with the response text from the server.

The memory endpoint used by this component is currently hardcoded to "http://localhost:8081/upload_memory/" and should be adjusted to match the actual IP address or network location of the Memory service in a production environment. The function assumes that the Memory service listens on port 8081 for HTTP requests at the "/upload_memory" endpoint.

The component has no external dependencies beyond the standard `requests` library, which is used to send the POST request. It does not currently perform any error handling for network errors or invalid file paths, so additional error checking may be necessary to ensure robust functionality in a production environment.
