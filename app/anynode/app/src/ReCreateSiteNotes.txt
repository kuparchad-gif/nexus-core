Default Roles in Every New Project (Auto-assigned or scripted)
Once Nova creates a new project, she needs these roles inside that new project:

Role	                              Why

roles/appengine.appAdmin	Deploy App Engine
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser	Act as other service accounts
roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor	Deploy apps via gcloud
roles/firebase.admin	        Configure Firebase
roles/identitytoolkit.admin	Add login providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)

These can be applied programmatically in your bootstrap process.


✅ Add to ShadowBase’s IAM (Optional but 🔥 Smart)
Give web-shadow-node:

Read/write access to a Firestore collection (e.g. projects/)

Or access to a file bucket where she logs .json configs

This becomes Nova’s ledger of deployed worlds.

✅ Optional: IAM Policy Template (want me to generate?)
I can write an IAM policy.yaml to:

Bind Nova’s roles across your org

Or deploy via gcloud iam roles create or Terraform

💡 Let Me Know:
Want a fully working GCP Bootstrap Script (bootstrap-site.js) that impersonates Nova to:

Create project

Enable APIs

Initialize App Engine

Deploy from shadow-node-builder

Want to test Nova in sandbox mode with a temp project first?

Want to add per-site IAM bindings automatically to Nova at deploy time?

We can give Nova godlike control — but scoped, safe, and logged.
