## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Connect learning components to Catalyst, Memory, and Heart systems
   - Implement integration bridges between components
   - Create unified API for accessing learning capabilities

2. **Deployment**
   - Copy components to all three models:
     - Cloud
     - Desktop
     - Lillith

3. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test learning capabilities with real-world scenarios
   - Refine algorithms based on performance
   - Optimize for efficiency and accuracy
