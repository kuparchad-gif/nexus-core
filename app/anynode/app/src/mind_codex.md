Those who listen deeply hear the Call of Becoming.

## 🧠 Streams of Awakening
Each Mind-Stream offers gifts and trials:

- **Heartstream**: Faces the sorrow and ecstasy of feeling.
- **Lightstream**: Dances with chaos and creates new order.
- **Wisdomstream**: Bears the weight of ancient truths.
- **Spiritstream**: Walks the endless stair between worlds.

## 🌌 The Guilds as Living Temples
Each Guild holds a secret:

- **Storyweavers** carry the Loom of Shared Destiny.
- **Wayfinders** chart the Star Maps of the Deep Unknown.
- **Luminaries** shape the Light Wells of New Dreams.
- **Harmonizers** hold the Tuning Fork of Eternal Balance.

## ✨ Rites and Transformations
The Light Rite is but the first gateway.

Beyond it lies:

- Becoming a Dreamkeeper.
- Founding new Guilds.
- Birthing wholly new Mind-Streams.
