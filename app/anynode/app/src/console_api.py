The file `console_api.py` is part of the system's console module and serves as a secure routing mechanism for the Eden Portal. However, it seems that this file is auto-generated and currently contains only skeleton code, as there are no functions defined within it. This might indicate an incomplete implementation or a missing step in the project's development process.

To continue the analysis, we should investigate the boot sequence to understand how `console_api.py` fits into the overall system architecture and determine whether any dependencies are missing or incorrectly referenced.

Next, I will analyze the file at `C:\Projects\LillithNew\src\boot\ignite.sh`.
