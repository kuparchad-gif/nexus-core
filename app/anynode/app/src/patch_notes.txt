nim_svc integration notes

- If you already have a nim_svc in your repo, copy over:
  * niv_stream.py  (template runner -> frames)
  * Inject into your service: from niv_stream import load_template, run_template
  * Add endpoint POST /run that streams 'event: frame' + 'event: done' using the generator pattern shown.

- Correlation-ID: supply 'cid' in body to thread frames; otherwise a UUID is generated.

- Engine hookup: niv_stream.py tries to import `thought_processing_engine` and maps modes:
  logical -> logical_reasoning()
  imaginative -> imagination()
  metacognitive -> metacognition()
  systemic -> systems_thinking()
  Each function is called with (step, action, state) and should return a dict (merged into state).
  Fallback: if engine not present, frames still emit with simulated state transitions.

- Templates: stored as JSON files named {type}.json under templates_root.
