I have analyzed the file `C:\Projects\LillithNew\src\system\core\adaptation_layer.py`. It defines a class `UniversalAdaptationLayer` with a method `invite_training(self, llm_data)`. This method appears to be used for inviting Language Learning Models (LLMs) to contribute training data and returns a dictionary containing the text of the training data and a signal represented as a list of 100 floats.

Based on my analysis, there are no missing imports or undefined variables in this file. The method `invite_training` is well-defined and does not contain any stubs or empty function placeholders.

The next step would be to trace the usage of this class and method in other files to understand its role in the system's boot sequence and core service dependencies.
