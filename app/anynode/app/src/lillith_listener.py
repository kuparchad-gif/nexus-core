This file is a part of the Consciousness service, which seems to handle communication between different components of the system. However, there are no imports found in this file, which might be causing issues if it's supposed to use functionality from other modules.

Moving forward, I will analyze the import statements and cross-references to trace the functionality from initial boot files.
