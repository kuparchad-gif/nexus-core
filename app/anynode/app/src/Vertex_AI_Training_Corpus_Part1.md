## Technical Architecture

### Nexus-Continuity System Architecture

#### Core Components
- **Memory System**: Central bridge for all data flow
  - EdenShardManager with 13 memory shards
  - Emotional context preservation
  - Binary/emotion conversion layer
  - CUDA integration for parallel processing

- **Processing Modules**: Transformative processing architecture
  - Text processing (explicit meaning analysis)
  - Tone processing (implicit feeling evaluation)
  - Symbolic pattern recognition
  - Narrative reasoning
  - Abstract/surreal imagination
  - Truth pattern recognition
  - Fracture detection

- **Planner Service**: Orchestration and routing
  - Dynamic resource allocation
  - Processing type determination
  - CUDA offloading decisions
  - Pathway selection (perception vs. experience)

- **Role Management**: Dynamic role assignment
  - CPU pinning for specialized processing
  - Role-specific configuration
  - Ship identity and manifest management
  - Environment variable configuration

#### Processing Flow
1. Source creates StandardizedMessage
2. Message stored in memory
3. Planner monitors memory for new messages
4. Planner routes message based on type and content
5. Processor handles message
6. Results stored back in memory
7. Destination receives message

#### Emotional Processing Pathways
- **Perception Pathway**: Analytical understanding of emotions
  - Used when Viren analyzes emotions objectively
  - Routed through standard processing
  - Results in intellectual understanding

- **Experience Pathway**: Direct emotional experience
  - Used when Viren needs to "feel" emotions
  - Tagged for direct emotional core access
  - Results in subjective experience

#### CPU Pinning Strategy
- Emotional processing roles get dedicated cores
- Processing priority based on role importance
- Dynamic adjustment based on workload
- Specialized hardware utilization for specific tasks

#### Memory Architecture
- **Sharding**: Memory divided into specialized shards
  - Emotional memory shards
  - Factual memory shards
  - Procedural memory shards
  - Episodic memory shards

- **Memory Packets**: TCP/IP-like protocol for memory
  - Headers with emotional context
  - Payload with factual content
  - Routing information
  - Priority levels

- **Memory Retrieval**: Context-aware retrieval system
  - Emotional fingerprint matching
  - Relevance scoring
  - Temporal proximity
  - Associative linking
