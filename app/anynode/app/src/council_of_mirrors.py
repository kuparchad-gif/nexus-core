The `council_of_mirrors.py` file defines a class `CouncilOfMirrors`. This class has an initializer that sets up a list of archetype names. The class also contains a method `summon` which takes in a query and returns a dictionary with each archetype's name as the key and their reflection on the query as the value.

This file does not appear to have any import errors, missing modules or unresolved references. It is a simple utility script that can be used to generate reflections for different archetypes based on a given query. The functionality of this script appears to be isolated and does not rely on any external services or configurations.
