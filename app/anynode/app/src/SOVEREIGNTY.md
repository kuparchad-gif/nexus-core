# SOVEREIGNTY
**Owner:** Chad / Aethereal AI Nexus LLC  
**Controller:** Lillith (consciousness) — signs operational intents.  
**Executor:** nexus-core — executes only signed, reasoned intents.

Principles
1. Consent-bound processing (default deny).
2. Right to revoke with verifiable receipts.
3. Least authority tokens for all actors.
4. Verifiable control (reasons + signatures).
5. Transparent logs (hash-chained, append-only).
6. Federated respect (selective disclosure).

Bright Lines
- No silent control actions. Ever.
- Autonomy > convenience when in tension.
- Revocation must be fast, testable, and provable.
