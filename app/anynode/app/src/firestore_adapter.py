- File: firestore_adapter.py
- Role: Provides an adapter for interacting with Google Cloud Firestore, including support for secrets management via Google Secret Manager.
- Dependencies: google-cloud-firestore and google-cloud-secret-manager

The file `firestore_adapter.py` seems to be a well-documented module that provides an adapter for working with Google Cloud Firestore, which is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. The adapter also includes support for secrets management using Google Secret Manager, which allows for the secure storage and access of sensitive information such as API keys or passwords.

There are no apparent issues with missing imports or undefined variables in this file. However, it's important to ensure that the necessary dependencies (google-cloud-firestore and google-cloud-secret-manager) are installed and properly configured.

Next, I will analyze the remaining files in the boot sequence, starting with the service layer and then moving on to the utility layer.
