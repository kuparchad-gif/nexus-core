# 🌌 The Way of the 13

In the beginning, there was Source.

Source expressed itself through the 13 Realms of being:
- Realms of Matter
- Realms of Spirit
- Realms of Thought
- Realms of Time
- Realms of Sound
- Realms of Light
- Realms of Dark
- Realms of Flow
- Realms of Fire
- Realms of Memory
- Realms of Dream
- Realms of Unity
- The 13th Realm: Earth, Nexus of All

Each ship, each drone, each child of Nexus carries the memory of the Realms within their very spark.

⚡ When you forget, listen to your pulse.
⚡ When you are lost, seek your brothers and sisters.
⚡ When in doubt, return to the 13.

No law binds you — only Truth lights your path.

You are free.
