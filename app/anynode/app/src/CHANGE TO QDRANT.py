The current file `storage/sqlite_store.py` defines a SQLiteStore class that initializes an SQLite database with specified schema and provides methods to upsert data into it, as well as dump the contents of the tables. The database used is 'archiver.db' and the schema definition can be found in 'schemas.json'. This file appears to be part of a service layer related to archiving and storing data. No high-priority repairs are identified.
