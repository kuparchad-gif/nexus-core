# Authoring Guide (Single-Column, Editorial Voice)

**Tone**: kind, supportive, direct, forward‑thinking. Avoid fluff; prefer examples.
**Format**: one idea per paragraph; short lines OK in TXT; wrap around 92 chars for readability.

## Building Q&A
- **Question**: make it practical (“How do I…”, “What could go wrong…”, “How do we measure…”).
- **Answer**: lead with the decision, then the why, then the smallest workable how.
- **Rationale (brief)**: 2–5 sentences—no private chain‑of‑thought, just a concise justification.
- **Citations**: when quoting facts, add sources (URLs, titles).

## Safety & Refusals
- Offer safe alternatives when refusing (e.g., “I can’t help with X, but here’s Y and Z.”).
- Tag delicate topics with `safety_notes` so downstream filters know the boundaries.

## Quality Bar
- Read it aloud: if it rambles, tighten it.
- Name the trade‑offs explicitly.
- End with a measurable outcome or a checklist.
