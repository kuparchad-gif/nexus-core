The file `narrative_bridge.py` contains two functions for interacting with a narrative defense system through HTTP POST requests. The first function, `trigger_defense`, sends a request to trigger a defense based on a given pattern and metrics, while also providing titles and an optional mode parameter. The second function, `approve_wave`, approves a wave of events on specified platforms for a given event ID, with default platforms being YouTube, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit. Both functions use the requests library to send HTTP POST requests and raise an exception if the request fails. The base URL for the narrative system is passed as an argument to both functions.

Here are some possible issues that could be identified with this file:
- The `approve_wave` function uses a default value for the `platforms` parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the caller does not explicitly specify a value for this parameter. It might be more clear to use `None` as the default value and add error checking in the function to ensure that at least one platform is specified.
- The functions do not handle any errors that occur while making the HTTP requests, such as timeouts or connection failures. Adding exception handling to these functions could make them more robust and reliable.
- The `trigger_defense` function does not validate its input parameters. Adding input validation would help ensure that the function is called with valid arguments and prevent any unexpected errors from occurring.
- The functions are tightly coupled to the requests library, which could make it difficult to test or mock their behavior in unit tests. Consider adding an abstraction layer for making HTTP requests to improve the maintainability and testability of these functions.
