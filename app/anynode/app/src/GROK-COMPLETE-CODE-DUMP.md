```
Input → ServicesService (data recognition) 
      → Route to appropriate service
      → Process with consciousness context
      → Integrate with temporal/emotional experience
      → Apply ego judgment/forgiveness if needed
      → Route through Gabriel's Horn frequencies
      → Output with soul prompt alignment
```
