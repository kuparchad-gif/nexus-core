- The file `C:\Projects\LillithNew\src\system\core\fib_bert_demo.py` is a standalone script that uses a trained BERT model to generate a productivity guide in Fibonacci structure. It also integrates with the `fib_sim.py` script for optimized batch sizes.
- This file doesn't interact directly with any other parts of the system, as it appears to be an independent demonstration and experimentation tool.
- The script imports necessary libraries (PyTorch, transformers), loads a pretrained BERT model, tokenizes input prompt, generates output using the model, decodes the output, and prints it for each optimized batch size obtained from `fib_sim.py`.
- There are no dependencies or cross-references with other parts of the system in this file.

Next, I will analyze `C:\Projects\LillithNew\src\system\core\fib_sim.py` to see if it has any interactions with the rest of the system.
