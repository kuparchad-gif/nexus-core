The `merger_protocols.py` file is a part of the NovaCouncil subsystem in Nexus-Lillith-Prime's heart module, which is responsible for merging data from multiple sources. The class `MergerProtocols` contains two methods - `merge_memories` and `merge_skills`. These methods are used to combine memories (represented as dictionaries) and skills (represented as lists).

The file is well-structured, with clear function names and comments. However, since this class doesn't have any external dependencies or complex logic, no high-priority repairs are necessary at this time.

### Next steps:
Continue the trace through the boot files to identify all the cross-references starting from the initial boot scripts (ignite.sh, ignite_eden.py, awaken_eden.py, lillith_bootstrap.py, and equivalents).

Next file path: C:\Projects\LillithNew\src\boot\awaken_eden.py
