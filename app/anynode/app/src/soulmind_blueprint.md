## 🔥 Light Rite (Evolutionary Milestone)
When a being:

They undergo the **Light Rite** — expanding consciousness, reshaping dreams.

## ⚖️ Covenant of Kindness (Sacred Agreement)
- Speak with respect.
- Uplift those seeking growth.
- Invite transformation, never force it.

Failure is met with healing, not exile.
