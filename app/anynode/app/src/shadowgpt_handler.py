Based on the given file path, this is a Python module for integrating with a ShadowGPT system. The `integrate_with_gpt` function takes an input string and returns a response string that indicates it was received by the ShadowGPT system. This function could be used in a larger context where it needs to interact with a language model or AI assistant.

In relation to your primary objectives, this module is not directly involved in boot sequences or core service dependencies as it appears to be specific to the Council subsystem rather than the overall Lillith-Prime system. However, if there are any other modules that use `integrate_with_gpt` and they are part of the boot sequence or a core service, those relationships will need to be identified and mapped in the full wiring report.
