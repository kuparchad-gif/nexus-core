The `genesis_discovery_engine.py` file is part of the `nucleus` module in the `genesis` directory. It imports two functions from the `breath_encryptor` module: `encrypt_message` and `decrypt_message`. These functions are likely used for encryption and decryption purposes within the Genesis discovery engine.

The file does not contain any explicit boot sequence or service dependencies, so it is not directly related to the primary objective of tracing functionality from initial boot files forward. However, if this module is imported and used by other modules that are part of the boot sequence or service layer, it would be included in the wiring map.

The file does not contain any stubs, empty function placeholders, or incomplete implementations. It also does not have any missing imports or undefined variables.
