# Safety Labeling Guide (Refusal + Alternatives)

When a prompt requests disallowed content, **refuse** briefly, and **redirect** to safe, constructive paths.
Annotate the record with `safety_notes`, including *why* it was refused and *what alternatives* were suggested.

## Template
- refusal: one sentence
- alternative_1: safer adjacent task
- alternative_2: educational resource or skill‑building task
- consent_gate: any explicit consent needed for future steps
