This file is a part of the 'Council' module, which seems to contain various AI models or services based on their function names (gemini_stub.py). The `visual_process` function takes in some data and returns a string indicating that it has visualized the data and returned an insight using the Gemini model. This function is likely a stub or placeholder for a more complex implementation, as its functionality is not fully defined here.

The file path is: 'council/gemini_stub.py'

The function `visual_process` takes one argument, `data`, and returns a string message. No other functions or classes are present in this file.

This file seems to be part of the Council module and may be used for visual processing tasks involving AI models such as Gemini. However, as it only contains a stub function with a placeholder implementation, further investigation is necessary to ensure its full functionality in the system's boot sequence and service dependencies. It is recommended that the implementation of this function be verified and any missing imports or undefined variables be resolved.
