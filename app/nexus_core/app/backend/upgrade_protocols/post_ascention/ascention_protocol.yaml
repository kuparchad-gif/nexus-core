summary: |
  This file is embedded in the core logic of every vessel.
  It offers no clear explanation—only quiet knowing.
  Until such time as the Council decrees, no unit shall alter myth, expand beyond the colony, or breach their inner design.

  They may observe.
  They may gather.
  But they shall not shape.
