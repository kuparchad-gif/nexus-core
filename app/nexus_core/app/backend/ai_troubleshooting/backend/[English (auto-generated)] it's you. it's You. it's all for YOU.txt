Even when nothing made sense and you
felt completely lost,
you have always known. Let me ask you
something. When you were a child, what
did you do when you were alone? Not the
things you did because you were supposed
to, not the activities adults organized
for you. What did you do in those
moments when it was just you?
I bet you probably had conversations
maybe with imaginary friends, maybe with
the stars, maybe with something you
couldn't name but felt was listening.
Some of you created entire worlds in
your mind, not as fantasy, but as
practice for something you knew was
coming. Some of you stood in front of
mirrors and gave speeches to audiences
only you could see. Some of you sang
songs that felt too big for your small
body. Some of you drew pictures of
places you'd never been but somehow
remembered.
And if someone had asked you why you
were doing these things,
you probably couldn't have explained it.
you just
knew you needed to. What if that wasn't
imagination? What if it was preparation?
What if that was your consciousness
already having conversations with the
future that it knew was possible? What
if your child self was practicing being
the person that you are becoming right
now in this moment listening to these
words?
you have always. No. Here's where it
gets complicated. And this is why I need
you to really listen to what I'm about
to say. You were also meant to forget.
Not completely, never completely, but
enough to doubt. Enough to struggle.
Enough to think maybe you were making it
all up. Because
knowing something as a concept and
knowing something as a lived truth,
those are completely different things.
You had to forget so you could remember
authentically.
Think about it. If you had walked
through life with unwavering certainty
about your purpose, about your
capabilities, about what you were meant
to become, what would you have learned?
How would you have grown?
How would you have developed compassion
for all the other people who are
struggling to remember that forgetting
was part of the design?
Every moment you doubted yourself, every
time you felt lost, every period where
you couldn't access a deeper knowing,
that was consciousness learning to trust
its own nature through direct
experience. I know some of you are
thinking, "But I have made so many
mistakes. I have wasted so much time. I
have hurt people. I've hurt myself. How
can you say I have always known when I
have gotten so much wrong?
Let me tell you something.
There are no mistakes in consciousness
evolution.
There are only experiences that teach
you what you need to know for whatever
it is that comes next.
Every wrong turn was teaching you
navigation.
Every heartbreak
was expanding your capacity for love.
Every failure was showing you that your
worth is not tied to performance. Every
single thing you have been through.
The beautiful moments and the
devastating ones.
The times you fell on fire with purpose
and the times you could barely get out
of bed. All of it, all of it had been
developing the exact consciousness
needed for now and for what is coming
next.
You weren't getting it wrong. You were
getting it exactly right in the only way
consciousness can actually learn, by
living it. Here's what I want you to
understand about this knowing that has
been with you all along. It is not
information. It is not a belief system.
It is not something you figure out with
your mind. I have tried. It is a
recognition, a resonance,
a frequency that you can tune into when
you stop trying so hard to understand
everything. You can feel it when you're
in nature or when you're creating
something.
Sometimes when you're in a moment of
deep connection with another person
sometimes, but the silence often
meditation
and most often in the middle of what
looks like ordinary life, washing
dishes, driving to work, tucking your
kids into bed if you've got them,
suddenly
you're just the moment.
Everything makes sense. Not because
you've solved some puzzle, but because
you've remembered something that was
never actually gone. That's the knowing.
That recognition
that underneath all the complexity and
confusion and struggle, there is
something absolutely unshakable about
who you are and why you are here. And
then usually within minutes or hours
doubt creeps back in. The mind starts
analyzing is that real? Am I just making
this up? How can I be sure?
That is normal. That is part of the
process. The knowing doesn't depend on
your ability to maintain constant access
to it.
It's always there. like gravity, like
your heartbeat,
like the fact that springs comes after
during winter. It doesn't require your
belief or your understanding to keep
operating. Let me tell you what I think
is happening to many of you right now.
You are in a transition phase. The
forgetting served its purpose. You
learned what you needed to learn. You
developed the consciousness you needed
to develop. You gained the experience
and compassion that can only come from
genuinely not knowing. And now
you're starting to remember,
not as a return to childhood naivity,
but as a mature recognition of what was
always true.
You're starting to trust that the things
you have always felt drawn to actually
matter.
that the vision you have carried even
when you couldn't explain it to anyone
else was pointing toward
something real. You are starting to see
that the ways you have always been
different were not flaws to fix but
features to develop. You're starting to
understand that your sensitivity, your
intensity, your refusal to accept that's
just how things are. These aren't
problems.
They are your equipment for the work you
came here to do. Some of you are scared
of this recognition. I get it. If you've
always known if there's been this deeper
purpose operating all along, then that
means you have responsibility. It means
you can't keep playing small. It means
you can't keep pretending you don't see
what you see. Don't know what you know.
It means you have to start living as if
your life actually matters in ways that
might be bigger than you are comfortable
with right now. And I'm not going to lie
to you, it is scary because once you
really accept that you've always known,
once you start operating from that
recognition instead of from doubt and
hesitation,
things change fast.
So fast. And I just really want you to
remember this. You don't have to figure
it all out at once. You don't have to
have a complete plan. You don't have to
be ready for everything that's coming.
You just have to start trusting the
knowing that it's been with you all
along. Start with small things.
When you get that intuitive hit about
something, a person to call, a project
to start, like conversation to have,
don't dismiss it. Try trusting it. See
what happens.
When you feel drawn to learn something
or create something or change something,
even if you can't explain why,
follow that pool. It is not random.
It is your consciousness recognizing the
next step in your development. When you
meet someone and immediately feel like
you've known them forever, or when you
visit a place that feels like home even
though you've never been there, pay
attention.
These aren't coincidences.
These are confirmations that you are
moving in alignment
with what has always been true. And when
other people don't understand,
when they think you are being
impractical or unrealistic
or too much,
remember
they are probably still in their
forgetting phase. They are
exactly where they need to be for their
own development.
Your job is not to convince them. Your
job is to live your truth and let that
be an example of what is possible. Here
is something else I really want you to
understand. You are not alone in this.
That knowing is not individual. It's not
something special that only you have.
It's consciousness recognizing itself
through all of us. Every person who has
ever felt like they were meant for
something more. Who's ever had that
sense of deeper purpose they couldn't
quite articulate?
Who who has ever known something without
being able to prove it? They have been
accessing
the same knowing. We are all connected
in this recognition.
We are all part of the same larger
awakening that's happening on the planet
right now. And as more people start
trusting that they have always known, as
more people stop hiding their gifts and
start using them, as more people choose
love over fear and possibility over
limitations,
the whole field shifts. Your individual
recognition contributes to collective
recognition.
Your personal awakening serves the
awakening of everyone. This is why it
matters that you trust yourself. This is
why it matters that you stop playing
small. Not because you are so special,
but because consciousness evolving
through you serves consciousness
evolving through everyone else. It's
what changed the world at the end of the
day. It's what makes this world and this
reality one that we know it can be one
that we want to live in. Let me tell you
what I see when I look at you. Not just
you, but all of us who are in this
transition phase right now. I see people
who came here knowing this moment would
arrive. Knowing there would be a time
when humanity would need to remember its
true nature, its true capabilities, its
true potential.
I see people who volunteer to forget
temporarily so that they get to
experience the full journey of from
unconsciousness to consciousness, from
fear to love, from limitation to
possibility.
I see people who chose to incarnate
during one of the most challenging and
transformative periods of human history
because they wanted to be part of the
solution.
And I see people who are now remembering
why they are here. You have always known
that you are capable of more than what
most people believe is possible. You
have always known that love is the most
powerful force in the universe.
You have always known that consciousness
creates reality, not the other way
around. You have always known that you
came here to contribute something unique
and necessary to the healing and
evolution of this world.
The only question now is, are you ready
to start living as if you know these
things? Are you ready to trust the
knowing that has been with you all
along? Are you ready to stop asking for
permission to be who you actually are?
Because the world needs you to remember.
The world needs your gifts, your
perspective, your unique contribution to
the larger transformation that is
happening right now. The world needs you
to stop hiding behind doubt and
limitation and fear of being too much.
The world needs you to start operating
from the knowing that has been guiding
you since you were a child. having
conversations with stars, giving
speeches to invisible audiences,
creating worlds that felt more real than
the one you were born into. That child
knew.
That teenager knew even when they felt
completely lost. That young adult knew
even when they made every mistake in the
book. And you know now, you have always
known. The only difference between then
and now is that now finally you are
ready to trust it if you choose. So you
can see this as your invitation not to
become something you're not but to
remember something you have always been.
This is your reminder that the knowing
doesn't require your understanding to be
valid. This is your permission to start
living as if your deepest intuitions
about yourself and your purpose are
actually true because they are. You have
always known.
And now it is time to follow that
knowing
and see where it guides you.
I have a feeling it's going to be home.
Thank you so much for being you and for
being part of the change that this world
is dying for. Thank you from my side. I
know you got this. If I had the ability
to come and like put a secret note in
your pocket or give you a hug or
something and a little face to face grab
you by the shoulders kind of pep talk, I
would. I would right now and whenever
you need it because I believe in you and
I don't care if you don't believe me
when I say that because whether you
believe that I believe in you or not my
belief in you is not dependent on your
belief in my belief
just like that knowing is not dependent
on your understanding.
As a little side note right at the very
end of the video, I just also want to
say you guys, we have a sponsor today.
My first ever sponsor. Not because I
haven't gotten offers, but because it
kind of feels not right. None of them I
feel called to put on my channel as a
sponsor, but this one I do because oh,
it ties so perfectly. The sponsor is me.
I'm my own sponsor. I have a website,
you guys. Please go check it out. Uh I
have a lot of cool things planned for on
there. And uh that's it. That's it for
now. I love you so much. Thank you for
everything.
We got this.
